## 🧪 Sample Case Study
### 🧠 Project #47 — Malware Traffic Analysis
**Goal:** Identify malicious communication patterns, extract IOCs, and analyze infection behavior.  
**Tools:** Wireshark, Zeek, Python  
**Focus Area:** DFIR, Threat Hunting

---

**Highlights**
- Analyzed PCAP traffic to trace attacker C2 communication  
- Identified beaconing intervals and payload exfiltration  
- Extracted Indicators of Compromise (domains, IPs, hashes)  
- Mapped findings to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques  

**Outcome**  
Improved detection strategy and deepened DFIR methodology for malware-based intrusions.
